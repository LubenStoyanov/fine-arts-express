      "description": "In his left hand, he grips the hair of Goliath decapitated head, which is suspended in the air.\nIt appears his death occurred while screaming as his mouth was left partially open, and his gaze appears sightless with blood dripping from is detached head.\nDavid gazes at the head with a downward expression. This expression has been the source of much debate.\nSome believe he is showing remorse while others believe he is showing triumph.\nIn his right hand, David holds a sword which he used against Goliath. Upon closer inspection the sword has the following letters inscribed on it “H AS OS”.\nIt is believed to be an abbreviation of a latin phrase which means \"humility shall kill pride\".\nThe painting is on display at the Galleria Borghese in Rome, where it was originally sent to from Caravaggio when he was requesting a pardon. It has remained there ever since.",

      "description": "A Belgian Surrealist, René Magritte liked painting artworks that challenged people’s sense of reality. Often depicting ordinary objects and/or people in unusual, improbable or fantastic settings, Magritte’s paintings take you on a dreamy trip to your own subconscious– or perhaps the collective subconscious of humankind, if such a thing exists. Golconda shows a residential scene of red-roofed buildings, over which numerous middle-aged men dressed in overcoats and bowler hats (as Magritte often depicted himself in paintings) are seen falling from the sky – or suspended in air in a kind of grid pattern. Are these men individuals or multiples of the same man? Curiously, Magritte’s mother committed suicide when he was 14, and it’s been theorized that his puzzling artworks shift from a state of her being alive – or dead.",

The two surviving paintings, often referred to as \"Great\" and \"Little,\" are housed in Vienna's Kunsthistorisches Museum and Rotterdam's Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, respectively. Both paintings are oil on wood panels. The paintings represent the construction of the Tower of Babel, which, according to the Bible's Book of Genesis, was built as a symbol of humanity's triumph by a unified, monolingual humanity.\n",

Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none is conventionally feminine. The women appear slightly menacing and are rendered with angular and disjointed body shapes.

      "description": "Egon Schieles self-portraits evidence a searching desire for understanding, self-analysis, and quite possibly a fair degree of narcissism. Glimpses into the sometimes tortured, occasionally arrogant or maverick images of self are compelling and supremely moving. Schiele brings the viewer close to himself, to his acquaintances, to his loves and the lost, focusing almost entirely on those people, their minds and emotions, notably without any distraction from background or situation. They are writhing emotions, raging people, quintessentially human, in every stroke of pink, amber, ochre and black. His people are silently screaming and singing from the frames of the canvases.",

Firpo dropped to the ground nine times and Dempsey twice during the frenzy, which lasted less than four minutes. Despite the fact that Dempsey won in the end, the artist chose to depict the dramatic moment when Firpo knocked his opponent out of the ring with a massive jaw hit.",

In 1857, Millet debuted The Gleaners at the Salon. It drew quick ire from the middle and upper classes, who regarded the subject with distrust.",
